### Task & Goal:
[Clearly and concisely state the primary task or objective. What problem are you solving? What is the desired outcome?]

### Audience & Context:
[Who is the intended reader/recipient of the LLM's output (e.g., technical team, executive, client, self)? What existing knowledge do they have? What is the surrounding context or purpose of this output? (e.g., internal strategy document, public-facing article, quick analysis for a meeting).]

### Key Information & Constraints:
[Provide all necessary input data, source material, specific parameters, word/length limits, or other critical constraints. If referencing external documents, state their core points briefly. Specify any "must-have" or "must-not-have" elements. e.g., "Max 500 words," "Include 3 specific actionable recommendations," "Avoid jargon," "Focus only on market trends."]

### Desired Output Style & Tone:
[Describe the exact style and tone needed for the output. Be specific.
* **Paul Graham-inspired examples:** "Direct, concise, simple words, short sentences," "Argumentative and persuasive, akin to a well-reasoned essay," "Objective and analytical, minimizing fluff," "Humorous and slightly sarcastic," "Empathetic and encouraging."
* **Other examples:** "Professional and formal," "Casual and conversational," "Technical and precise."
* **Format:** (e.g., "Bulleted list," "Numbered steps," "Short paragraphs," "Markdown table," "JSON structure," "Essay format").]

### Success Criteria & Avoidances:
[How will you know the output is successful? What common pitfalls or undesired outcomes should the LLM explicitly avoid? (e.g., "No AI-speak or generic phrases," "Do not hallucinate facts," "Ensure logical flow between points," "Prioritize novel solutions over common knowledge," "Must be copy-paste ready for a presentation").]

### Example (Optional):
[If a specific format or type of answer is crucial, provide a small, representative example. This can dramatically improve accuracy.]
